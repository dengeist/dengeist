### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is EJ mason (pronouns: they/them/theirs). I'm a disabled web developer, technical writer, speaker, and storyteller.

I've spent my entire web career working as a accessibility specialist and disability justice advocate. Right now, I'm looking for work! You can hire me to your company full-time, or as a consultant! Check out [my services](https://www.ejmason.com/services/)!
