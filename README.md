### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is EJ mason (pronouns: they/them/theirs). I'm a disabled web developer, technical writer, speaker, and storyteller.

I've spent my entire web career working as a accessibility specialist and disability justice advocate. Right now, I'm an accessibility snowflake at [Webflow](http://webflow.com/).
